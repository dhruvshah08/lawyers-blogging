# lawyers-blogging
The Law Journal - A Lawyer’s Blogging Website is a MERN Stack based web application that runs on a portal site, in which different lawyers (and lawyer groups) can publish and revise daily journal entries, and these entries will be made public for others to view. This system allows users (in our case 'Lawyers') to create their blog, where other lawyers can publish their opinions. There is also a category list where posts can be saved by it’s relevant category. We have also provided extensive search options and filters to find a particular blog.
Mern stands for MongoDB, Express, React, Node, after the four key technologies that make up the stack. 
MongoDB Atlas - is a multi-cloud application data platform. At its core is our fully managed cloud database for modern applications. Atlas is the best way to run MongoDB, the leading non-relational database.
